  - Express: Web application framework for Node.js.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install

   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

4. MongoDB Atlas Setup

This project utilizes MongoDB Atlas as its database solution. Follow the steps below to set up MongoDB Atlas and obtain the connection string required for your application.

1. **Create a MongoDB Atlas Account**:

2. **Get Connection String**:


    - In the MongoDB Atlas dashboard, click on the "Connect" button for your cluster.
    - Choose "Connect your application" and copy the connection string provided.

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:


    - Rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env`.
    - Replace the placeholder `<YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING>` with the actual connection string you obtained from MongoDB Atlas.

## Environment Variables

Ensure that you have the following environment variables set in your `.env` file as given in `.env.sample` file:

4. Start the frontend and backend servers:

   ```bash
   # In the backend directory
   npm start

   # In the frontend directory
   npm start
   ```

5. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
